.TH OSMUPDATE "1" "September 2013"
.SH NAME
osmupdate \- Update OSM files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBosmupdate\fR \fIoptions\fR [\fIoldfile\fR] [\fInewfile\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program cares about updating an .osm, .o5m or .pbf file. It
will download and apply OSM Change files (.osc) from the servers of
"planet.openstreetmap.org".
It also can assemble a new .osc or .o5c file which can be used to
update your OSM data file at a later time.
.PP
Prequesites
.PP
To run this program, please download and install two other programs
first: "osmconvert" and "wget".
.PP
Usage
.PP
Two command line arguments are mandatory: the name of the old and the
name of the new OSM data file. If the old data file does not have a
file timestamp, you may want to specify this timestamp manually on
the command line. If you do not, the program will try to determine
the timestamp by examining the whole old data file.
Instead of the second parameter, you alternatively may specify the
name of a change file (.osc or .o5c). In this case, you also may
replace the name of the old OSM data file by a timestamp.
Command line arguments which are not recognized by osmupdate will be
passed to osmconvert. Use this opportunity to supply a bounding box
or a bounding polygon if you are going to update a regional change
file. You also may exclude unneeded meta data from your file by
specifying this osmconvert option: \fB\-\-drop\-author\fR
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
The program osmupdate recognizes a few command line options:
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-days\fR=\fIUPDATE_RANGE\fR
.IP
By default, the maximum time range for to assemble a
cumulated changefile is 250 days. You can change this by
giving a different maximum number of days, for example 300.
If you do, please ensure that there are daily change files
available for such a wide range of time.
.PP
\fB\-\-minute\fR
\fB\-\-hour\fR
\fB\-\-day\fR
\fB\-\-sporadic\fR
.IP
By default, osmupdate uses a combination of minutely, hourly
and daily changefiles. If you want to limit these changefile
categories, use one or two of these options and choose that
category/ies you want to be used.
The option \fB\-\-sporadic\fR allows processing changefile sources
which do not have the usual "minute", "hour" and "day"
subdirectories.
.PP
\fB\-\-max\-merge\fR=\fICOUNT\fR
.IP
The subprogram osmconvert is able to merge more than two
changefiles in one run. This ability increases merging speed.
Unfortunately, every changefile consumes about 200 MB of main
memory while being processed. For this reason, the number of
parallelly processable changefiles is limited.
Use this commandline argument to determine the maximum number
of parallelly processed changefiles. The default value is 7.
.PP
\fB\-t\fR=\fITEMPPATH\fR
\fB\-\-tempfiles\fR=\fITEMPPATH\fR
.IP
On order to cache changefiles, osmupdate needs a separate
directory. This parameter defines the name of this directory,
including the prefix of the tempfiles' names.
The default value is "osmupdate_temp/temp".
.PP
\fB\-\-keep\-tempfiles\fR
.IP
Use this option if you want to keep local copies of every
downloaded file. This is strongly recommended if you are
going to assemble different changefiles which overlap in
time ranges. Your data traffic will be minimized.
Do not invoke this option if you are going to use different
change file sources (option \fB\-\-base\-url\fR). This would cause
severe data corruption.
.PP
\fB--trust-tempfiles\fR
.IP
Use this option if you want to use the saved local copies
of already downloaded changefiles without checking their
lengths against to their server-hosted originals.
Downloads will be limited to files not saved yet.
Do not invoke this option if you suspect incomplete
downloads.
.PP
\fB\-\-compression\-level\fR=\fILEVEL\fR
.IP
Define level for gzip compression. Values between 1 (low
compression, but fast) and 9 (high compression, but slow).
.PP
\fB\-\-base\-url\fR=\fIBASE_URL\fR
.IP
To accelerate downloads or to get regional file updates you
may specify an alternative download location. Please enter
its URL, or simply the word "mirror" if you want to use
gwdg's planet server.
.PP
\fB\-\-base\-url\-suffix\fR=\fIBASE_URL_SUFFIX\fR
.IP
To use old planet URLs, you may need to add the suffix
"\-replicate" because it was custom to have this word in the
URL, right after the period identifier "day" etc.
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.IP
With activated 'verbose' mode, some statistical data and
diagnosis data will be displayed.
If \fB\-v\fR resp. \fB\-\-verbose\fR is the first parameter in the line,
osmupdate will display all input parameters.
.SH NOTES
.PP
This program is for experimental use. Expect malfunctions and data
loss. Do not use the program in productive or commercial systems.
.PP
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

.SH EXAMPLE
osmupdate old_file.o5m new_file.o5m
.br
osmupdate old_file.pbf new_file.pbf
.br
osmupdate old_file.osm new_file.osm
.IP
The old OSM data will be updated and written as new_file.o5m
or new_file.o5m. For safety reasons osmupdate will not delete
the old file. If you do not need it as backup file, please
delete it by yourself.
.IP
osmupdate old_file.osm 2011\-07\-15T23:30:00Z new_file.osm
.br
osmupdate old_file.osm NOW\-86400 new_file.osm
.IP
If your old OSM data file does not contain a file timestamp,
or you do not want to rely on this timestamp, it can be
specified manually. Relative times are in seconds to NOW.
.IP
osmupdate old_file.o5m change_file.o5c
.br
osmupdate old_file.osm change_file.osc
.br
osmupdate 2011\-07\-15T23:30:00Z change_file.o5c
.br
osmupdate 2011\-07\-15T23:30:00Z change_file.osc.gz
.br
osmupdate NOW\-3600 change_file.osc.gz
.IP
Here, the old OSM data file is not updated directly. An OSM
changefile is written instead. This changefile can be used to
update the OSM data file afterwards.
You will have recognized the extension .gz in the last
example. In this case, the OSM Change file will be written
with gzip compression. To accomplish this, you need to have
the program gzip installed on your system.
.IP
\&./osmupdate london_old.o5m london_new.o5m \fB\-B\fR=\fIlondon\fR.poly
.IP
The OSM data file london_old.o5m will be updated. Hence the
downloaded OSM changefiles contain not only London, but the
whole planet, a lot of unneeded data will be added to this
regional file. The \fB\-B=\fR argument will clip these superfluous
data.
